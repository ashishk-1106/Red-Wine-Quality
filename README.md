# Red Wine Quality Predictor

A Machine Learning and Streamlit mini-project that predicts the quality of red wine (0–10) based on its acidity and alcohol content.  
It uses a manual linear regression model (Normal Equation) implemented from scratch using NumPy.

## Project Summary

- Framework: Streamlit  
- Language: Python  
- Libraries Used: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Streamlit  
- Algorithm: Manual Linear Regression (Normal Equation Method)  
- Dataset: Wine Quality Dataset (UCI / Kaggle)  
- Inputs: Fixed Acidity, Alcohol  
- Output: Predicted Wine Quality (0–10)  
- Accuracy: Computed by rounding predictions and comparing with actual values  
- Visuals:
  - Dataset preview and summary table  
  - Regression equation display  
  - Predicted vs Actual plot  
  - Interactive sliders for input
  -
